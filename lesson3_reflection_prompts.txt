When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Maybe if you want to make your code open source/free for other users to use or build upon. Maybe as a mechanism for backing up, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    What if it has issues and some other developers made other changes, etc.??

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

We use forking on repositories owned by other developmers and where we can't change the code there (not a collaborator?). So forking acutally is cloning that to our own repository where we either can edit it there or clone it to owr local machine then push it back to our repository. Branching is done on a single repository for experimental/new feature reasons.





    What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    Reduce the risk of conflict (e.g. due to changes by other developers, etc.)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

By e-mails, messnger, etc. Using GitHub/Git should be easier for traking purposes..

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Experimental/new feature purposes but it normally complicates things where  you need to merge with master again and push, maybe add a pull request, etc.
